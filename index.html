Formula One is a sport know as the pinnacle of motorsport racing, however most peaople dont understand the significance of the egineering behind it. 
This paper will explore the physics behind aerodynamic designs in modern F1 racing cars and how airflow is utilised to make the car as optimal as 
possible when taking sharp corners at dangerousily high speeds. This paper highlights the balance between minimising drag and maximising grip, 
and show how small aerodynamic changes can significantly influence handling and lap time.

 <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <pre id="Introduction_InText">  
Formula One is an extremely competitive sport in which even the smallest design changes to a car can have a significant impact 
on its performance and known as the epitome of racing in modern day motorsports. It consists of highspeed sharp turns that 
require the cars to be heavily optimized aerodynamicaly, to generate as much downforce as possible without sacrificing speed. 
Every second counts and so the manipulation of airflow around the vehicles heavily affect the speed and stability of the car 
which can be the difference between winning or losing. As a result of this teams invest millions to innovate new technology,
to push the limits and reach record breaking speeds.

   <b><u>Front Wing</u></b>
         <br>
  <a>
The front wing manipulates airflow and creates downforce, creating better stability and grip for the car. The front wing is an 
inverted airfoil which forces air flowing over the surface on top to be slowed. This creates high pressure on top whilst on the
bottom the faster moving air creates low pressure, this difference in pressure creates a net downforce. Modern designs also use 
the wing to direct  air from the front wheels, to seal the underbody and protect the car behind.
<br>
"As shown in the sketch in Fig. 1, the geometry consists of a multi-element wing in ground effect, leading to the generation of a 
series of interacting vortical structures, thereby creating a highly complex flow environment downstream of the wing. Accurately 
modelling these vortices and their interactions, by capturing their relative position and strength, is of utmost importance for a 
successful front wing design."

<b><u>Rear Wing</u></b>
         <br>
         <a>
The back wing is very similar to the front wing, however is shaped like an inverted airplane wing and has a special feature called 
DRS(drag reduction system). The DRS is a moveable flap that the drivers can open to reduce drag by letting airflow through the rear 
wing. What it does is reduce the area the air has to pass over the car, reducing the drag and the downforce. This increases top speed 
by 10–20 km/h which allows the drivers to reach incredible speeds on the straights. Furthermore there are two endplates on either end
of the rear wing to reduce wingtip vortices by preventing high-pressure air from spilling under the wing, However due to 2022 regulations 
Endplates are now simpler, focusing on reducing turbulance for cars behind.

Downforce is one of the most critical parameters for an F1 open-wheel racing car, along with power,
weight, and tires. The rare wing is the main part that creates the most downforce where the air near
the bottom surface of the wing flow must faster than that on the top surface. The nonsymmetrical airfoil
in the rare wing is similar to what is shown in Figure 1, where the end tip is tilted up at an angle.
According to Bernoulli's effect and equation, the faster the velocity of the flow, the lower the pressure. 
Therefore, due to the flow velocity difference between the top and bottom surface, the air pressure
on the top surface is larger than that on the bottom, which creates downforce. Moreover, the end tip of 
the airfoil is tilted upward. According to Newton's Third Law, there is an equal and opposite force
exerted back for every force exerted on an object. This law is also applied to tilting in the airfoil, in
which the tilting part pushes the air upwards, and therefore the air pushes the airfoil downwards.

   <b><u>Chassis stiffness</u></b>
    <br>
<a>
A stiff chassis provides a solid foundation for the suspension to work from. This is important as a solid chassis ensures thee suspension
is acurate and predicatable. It ensures that when the suspension moves, the intended forces are applied to the tires, and the chassis 
doesn't twist and absorb those forces instead. This improves the handling of the vehicle by making the suspension more effective, 
which in turn creates more traction leading to sharper steering, Furthermore when a driver turns the wheel, a stiffer chassis inputs 
into the suspension and tires more quickly and accurately. This results in a more direct and responsive feel. It is usually found that
a chassis that has enough torsional stiffness usually has "ample rigidity in bending; as a consequence torsional rigidity represents the
main criterion of chassis design, and the primary function of a high-performance chassis"

<br>

<b><u>Suspension</u></b>
         <br>
<a>
Suspension systems are spring mechanisms that connect the chassis of a car to the wheels. Suspension is important in ensuring that the car
remains in contact with the ground at all times. They also control the ride height and pitch of the car to ensure that aerodynamic devices, 
such as the floor and wings, function efficiently. A Formula One car usually uses a double-wishbone suspension system combined with either
pushrod or pullrod actuation. Pushrod and pullrod systems transfer wheel motion to springs and dampers located inside the chassis, 
lowering the center of gravity and allowing cleaner airflow around the car.
the following image shows elements of a Formula One car suspension; the wish bones are colored black, the push rods are colored green, and 
the track rods are colored red. The wheel carrier fixed points are shown as blue hexagrams. The car-body fixed points, the chassis ends of 
the push rods, and the chassis ends of the track rods are marked with red hexagrams.
